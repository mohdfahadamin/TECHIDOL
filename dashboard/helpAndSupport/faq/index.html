                    <p class="p-heading">A Learning Management System is an effective tool that is created and designed
                        to establish
                        administration, documentation, reporting, tracking, and deliver online learning. It’s also known
                        as
                        “e-learning” because the software that is used will provide a virtual classroom-like environment
                        for
                        training organization employee and trainers alike.</p>

                    <h3 class="h3-heading">Why does your company need LMS?</h3>
                    <p class="p-heading">Along with various LMS features, enabling online training for corporate
                        learners can provide you with many benefits of LMS, as well. When you use concepts like
                        e-learning and online training instead of traditional classroom training sessions, then you will
                        reduce costs and enhance productivity throughout the organization. For instance, when you
                        implement mandatory training sessions on food hygiene and fire safety can be taken when it’s a
                        slow day at work instead of taking employees to a different location altogether. Tracking and
                        monitoring an employee’s progress at work, through LMS, will make it easy for management during
                        the audit process instead of sifting through endless piles of paperwork.

                    <h3 class="h3-heading">Can Instructors track progress of Trainees?</h3>
                    <p class="p-heading">LMS has built in course progress tracking feature which allows Instructor to
                        see the current status of each Trainee and their progress. Attendance management reports are
                        also available in the LMS.
